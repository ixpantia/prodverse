## What is the prodverse exactly?

The prodverse is a collection of tools and R packages that help you build, deploy,
and maintain production-ready data products written with the R programming language.

The goals of the prodverse are to:

  - **Make R scalable**: R is a great language for data science, but
    many times the tools to scale it to many users are missing.
    The prodverse aims to fill this gap.
  - **Make R ready for production**: R with Shiny and Plumber are amazing
    tools, but there are many things that are needed to make them production-ready.
    Authentication, logging, and replication are just a few of the things that
    the prodverse provides.
  - **No vendor lock-in**: The prodverse aims to provide a great experience
    anywhere you want to deploy your R applications.

## Should I consider the prodverse over other tools?

The prodverse is not for everyone. If you are looking for a tool that allows
for one-click deployment and easy sharing of your R applications, Rmarkdown /
quarto docuemtns, and more then you should
consider [Posit Connect](https://posit.co/products/enterprise/connect/). Posit
Connect is a great tool for sharing your R applications with your data science
team or your organization.

If your data science team is not ready for a full-fledged data science platform
like Posit Connect, or needs a more customized solution, then the prodverse
might be a good fit for you.
